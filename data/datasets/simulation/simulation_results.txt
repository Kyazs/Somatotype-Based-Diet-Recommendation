   Height: 165.0 cm
   Age: 21 years
   Goal: Gain Weight
   Activity Level: Moderately active
   Somatotype Rating: 3-3-6 (Heath-Carter)

üìè ANTHROPOMETRIC ANALYSIS:
   BMI: 18.4 (Underweight)
   Healthy Weight Range: 50.4-67.8 kg
   Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): 1431 kcal/day
   Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE): 2218 kcal/day

üìä SOMATOTYPE ANALYSIS:
   Raw Components: Endomorphy=3.0, Mesomorphy=3.0, Ectomorphy=6.0
   Dominant Type: Ectomorph
   Classification: Strongly Ectomorphic
   Description: Lean, low body fat, difficulty gaining weight

   Key Characteristics:
     ‚Ä¢ Fast metabolism
     ‚Ä¢ Linear build
     ‚Ä¢ Low muscle mass
     ‚Ä¢ Low fat storage

üèãÔ∏è EXERCISE RECOMMENDATION ANALYSIS:
   Primary Training Focus: Strength training for muscle building and weight gain
   Goal Alignment: Optimized for gain weight
   Somatotype Rationale: Compound movements and progressive overload for muscle building

   Training Parameters:
     ‚Ä¢ Weekly Frequency: 4-5 sessions per week
     ‚Ä¢ Session Duration: 45-60 minutes
     ‚Ä¢ Intensity: Moderate to high
     ‚Ä¢ Progression: Linear progression suitable for ectomorphs

   Ectomorph-Specific Training Benefits:
     ‚Ä¢ Responds well to strength training for muscle building
     ‚Ä¢ Benefits from compound movements
     ‚Ä¢ Requires adequate recovery between sessions
     ‚Ä¢ Progressive overload essential for growth

   Somatotype-Specific Exercise Selection:
   Based on Universal Exercise Database + Goal/Activity Optimization:

   **Strength Training (71% of routine):**
     1. Semi Squat Jump (Male) - Functional movement pattern (Target: cardiovascular system)
     2. Jump Squat - Lower body power (Target: glutes)
     3. Bodyweight Drop Jump Squat - Plyometric strength (Target: glutes)
     4. Jump Squat V. 2 - Variation for progression (Target: glutes)
     5. Archer Pull Up - Functional movement pattern (Target: lats)

   **Power Training (28% of routine):**
     6. Kneeling Jump Squat - Functional movement pattern (Target: glutes)
     7. Barbell Jump Squat - Functional movement pattern (Target: glutes)


üçΩÔ∏è NUTRITION RECOMMENDATION ANALYSIS:

   Caloric Distribution:
     ‚Ä¢ Total Daily Calories: 2518 kcal
     ‚Ä¢ Base TDEE: 2218 kcal (activity-adjusted)
     ‚Ä¢ Goal Adjustment: +300 kcal for gain weight

   Macronutrient Breakdown:
   | Macro         | Grams | Calories | Percentage | Ectomorph Rationale |
   |---------------|-------|----------|------------|---------------------|
   | Protein       | 157g  | 628 kcal  | 25%        | Adequate protein for muscle building |
   | Carbohydrates | 314g  | 1256 kcal  | 50%        | High carbs for energy and recovery |
   | Fats          | 69g  | 621 kcal  | 25%        | Healthy fats for calorie density |

   Ectomorph-Specific Nutrition Strategy:
     ‚Ä¢ Meal Timing: Frequent meals every 2-3 hours, including pre-bed snack
     ‚Ä¢ Pre-Workout: Complex carbs + protein (1-2 hours before)
     ‚Ä¢ Post-Workout: Protein + fast carbs (within 30 minutes)
     ‚Ä¢ Hydration: 3.5 liters per day

   Food Category Analysis:

   **Proteins (Lean sources for ectomorphs):**
     Chicken breast - High biological value protein
     Salmon - Omega-3 fatty acids + protein
     Eggs - Complete amino acid profile
     Greek yogurt - Casein protein for sustained release
     Protein powder - Convenient post-workout option

   **Carbohydrates (Optimized for ectomorph metabolism):**
     Oats - Sustained energy release
     Brown rice - Complex carbohydrates
     Sweet potatoes - Nutrient-dense carbs
     Quinoa - Complete protein + carbs
     Whole grain bread - B vitamins + fiber

   **Fats (Strategic selection for ectomorphs):**
     Nuts - Calorie-dense healthy fats
     Avocado - Monounsaturated fats
     Olive oil - Anti-inflammatory fats
     Peanut butter - Convenient calorie source
     Seeds - Essential fatty acids

üí° PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
   ‚Ä¢ BMI analysis: 18.4 (Underweight)
   ‚Ä¢ Gender-specific BMR calculation: 1431 kcal/day
   ‚Ä¢ Activity-adjusted TDEE: 2218 kcal/day
   ‚Ä¢ Somatotype-specific metabolism considerations
   ‚Ä¢ Goal-oriented calorie and macro adjustments
   ‚Ä¢ Activity level modifications for energy needs
   ‚Ä¢ Age-appropriate nutritional requirements

üìà EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
   ‚Ä¢ Gradual weight gain (0.5-1 lb/week)
   ‚Ä¢ Increased muscle mass with consistent training
   ‚Ä¢ Improved strength and body composition
