## **Part I: Foundational Principles of Somatotyping**

### **1.1. The Origins and Evolution of Body Typology**

The classification and analysis of the human physique have been a subject of interest since antiquity, with early ideas attributed to Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, respectively.1 However, the modern, widely recognized concept of "somatotype" was formally introduced in the 1940s by psychologist W.H. Sheldon.1 Sheldon's initial theory proposed three primary body types—endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph—and attempted to link these physical characteristics to specific personality traits.2 This foundational work was later complemented by a more quantitative approach.

A core tenet of Sheldon's original work was the belief that somatotype was a "genotype character" and, therefore, a fixed, unchanging attribute for life.1 This deterministic view has since been widely challenged and refuted by modern research, which understands somatotype as a more dynamic, or plastic, reflection of an individual's current state.1 The early associations between physique and personality have also been discredited, often being viewed as problematic and contributing to bias and stigma.2 To move beyond these outdated notions, the scientific community adopted the Heath-Carter Somatotype Method, a significant modification developed in 1967\.1 This method is the globally accepted standard for its reliability and its focus on a quantifiable description of the body's present morphological conformation rather than on a fixed, unchangeable identity.4

### **1.2. The Heath-Carter Somatotype Method: A Quantifiable Approach**

The Heath-Carter method provides a precise, three-numeral rating to describe an individual's physique.4 These three sequential numbers always appear in the same order and correspond to the three primary components of body composition: endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy.1 Each numeral is an evaluation of a specific aspect of an individual's physical form, with ratings assigned on a continuous scale from 0.5 to 9 or higher.1

The three components are defined as follows:

* **First Component (Endomorphy):** This numeral represents an individual's relative fatness.4 It quantifies the degree of fatness on a continuum from the lowest to the highest recorded values.1  
* **Second Component (Mesomorphy):** This component refers to relative musculo-skeletal development per unit of height.4 It is an evaluation of the individual's muscularity and can be conceptually understood as the quantification of lean body mass relative to height.1  
* **Third Component (Ectomorphy):** This numeral describes the relative linearity or elongation of an individual's physique.1 Ectomorphy ratings are largely based on the height-to-weight ratio, where a high value indicates a lanky build and a low value indicates relative shortness.4

The precision of the Heath-Carter method comes from its reliance on objective anthropometric measurements. To calculate the three ratings, a series of measurements are required, including height, weight, skinfold thicknesses (triceps, subscapular, supraspinale, and calf), and bone diameters (humerus and femur).4 The raw data from these measurements can be used in specific equations to assign a precise decimal rating for each of the three components.4

This quantitative approach provides a nuanced foundation for the six simplified categories used in the system's user interface—Endomorph, Mesomorph, Ectomorph, Endo-Meso, Meso-Ecto, and Ecto-Endo. While the system presents discrete classifications, it is built upon an understanding of the underlying, continuous spectrum. For example, a user classified as an Ecto-Endo may have an actual rating of 3-1-5, which is a different starting point than a "pure" ectomorph with a rating of 1-1-7. By recognizing that these classifications are a simplification of a more detailed, quantifiable model, the system can provide a more intelligent and adaptable user experience. It can, for instance, track a user's progress not just by weight but by their movement along the somatotype spectrum (e.g., an endo-mesomorph successfully losing fat and moving toward a more pure mesomorph rating).

### **1.3. A Critical Review: Scientific Validity and Nuanced Application**

When considering the application of somatotype to diet and fitness, a critical examination of the scientific consensus is essential. The concept of "body type diets" has generated both support and skepticism within the health and fitness community.2 Some experts contend that there is a lack of robust scientific evidence specifically supporting dietary and exercise recommendations for each body type.2 Critics argue that the somatotype model is too broad, too static, and lacks the predictive power needed to justify its use as a primary diagnostic tool.3

However, a more nuanced perspective reveals the value of the somatotype framework as a descriptive tool rather than a rigid, predictive one. Research indicates a significant relationship between somatotype and various physiological characteristics, including body composition, metabolic tendencies, and dietary intake.7 For example, studies have shown that individuals with endomorphic traits tend to consume more protein, while those with ectomorphic traits often consume the least.2 A 2023 study published in the

*International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism* found that nutrition plans tailored to specific body types can improve performance metrics by as much as 28% compared to a one-size-fits-all approach.8 Furthermore, a 2024 report on exercise synergy found that aligning nutrition and exercise plans resulted in a 34% improvement in body composition changes.8

The system's approach is to use somatotype not as a fixed "diagnosis" but as a valuable "snapshot" of a user's current physical state.3 This understanding allows the system to function as a data-driven tool for solving a body composition problem, not for defining a user's immutable identity.9 For instance, ectomorphs are not doomed to remain "lanky" forever; with the right diet and exercise, they can build muscle and develop a more mesomorphic physique.3 Similarly, endomorphs can reduce fat mass and improve their metabolic efficiency, fundamentally altering their body composition over time.3 The system's true value lies in its ability to create a personalized plan based on a user's starting point, with the clear understanding that the goal is to consistently alter their physique in pursuit of their fitness goals.

## **Part II: The Primary Somatotypes**

The following sections provide a detailed manual for diet and fitness protocols for the three primary somatotypes, encompassing strategies for different goals, activity levels, and exercise complexities.

### **2.1. The Endomorph**

The Endomorph body type is characterized by a naturally soft and round physique with a larger bone structure.10 Individuals with this build tend to gain weight easily, particularly fat, and often have a slower metabolism.11 They may also be more susceptible to insulin resistance.10 The primary challenge for endomorphs is to manage fat gain and optimize metabolic efficiency.

#### **Dietary Framework for Endomorphs**

The nutritional strategy for endomorphs is designed to address a potentially slower metabolism and a greater tendency to store fat. The focus is on a lower-carbohydrate, higher-protein, and higher-fat diet to promote fat loss, increase satiety, and improve insulin sensitivity.10

* **Core Macronutrient Principles:** A widely recommended macronutrient split for endomorphs is 20-30% carbohydrates, 30-40% protein, and 30-40% fat.10 A lower-carbohydrate approach helps manage blood sugar levels and may assist with fat loss.10 It is crucial, however, to focus on complex carbohydrates and avoid refined, simple sugars.13  
* **Globally Acceptable Food Lists:**  
  * **Proteins:** Lean meats (chicken, turkey, lean beef), fatty fish (salmon, tuna), eggs, and plant-based proteins (tofu, legumes).10  
  * **Complex Carbohydrates & Fiber:** Non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, leafy greens, asparagus, zucchini), nutrient-dense starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, yams, carrots), ancient grains (quinoa, amaranth), beans, and legumes.10 Fruits should be consumed in moderation, focusing on high-fiber options like berries and apples.10  
  * **Healthy Fats:** Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from sources like olive oil, avocado oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flax), and fatty fish.13  
* **Recommendations by Goal and Activity Level:**  
  * **Lose Weight:** The goal is a calorie deficit to encourage fat loss.10 A good starting point is to consume 10 to 12 kilocalories per pound of body weight per day.12 Portion control is vital to prevent overconsumption.13  
  * **Gain Weight:** This is generally not the recommended goal for pure endomorphs, as they tend to gain fat easily.11 The focus should remain on building lean muscle mass and managing fat, which is often a secondary goal to fat loss.  
  * **Maintain Weight:** A neutral calorie balance is required, with a continued emphasis on a high-protein, balanced macronutrient diet to support muscle mass and metabolism.17

#### **Fitness Framework for Endomorphs**

The ideal fitness plan for endomorphs is a blend of strength training and cardio to maximize calorie expenditure and boost resting metabolism.18

* **Core Training Principles:** The primary focus is fat loss and building muscle to increase metabolic rate.15 This is best achieved through a combination of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training.19 A high training frequency of five to six sessions per week is recommended to keep the body in an active fat-burning state.19  
* **Detailed Exercise Plan (Male/Female)**

| Exercise Complexity | Weekly Structure & Frequency | Gym-Based Exercises | Outdoor/At-Home Exercises |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Beginner** | 3 days strength, 2 days LISS cardio. Time: 45-60 min/session. | Full-Body Strength: Compound exercises such as squats, push-ups (modified), and bent-over rows with dumbbells. Cardio: Low-intensity steady-state (LISS) cardio on the treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike (30-45 mins).18 | **Full-Body Strength:** Bodyweight exercises like squats, modified push-ups, and step-ups.18 |  Cardio: Brisk walking, cycling, or swimming for 30-45 minutes.15 |  |  |
| **Intermediate** | 3-4 days strength, 2-3 days HIIT/Cardio. Rest: 30-60 sec between sets. | **Full-Body Circuits:** Incorporate supersets or circuits with moderate to heavy weights (6-10 reps).15 |  Examples: Deadlifts, bench presses, and bent-over rows. HIIT: 20-minute sessions on a rowing machine or a stationary bike (e.g., 30 sec intense, 90 sec rest).19 | **HIIT/Metabolic Conditioning:** Bodyweight HIIT (e.g., burpees, mountain climbers, kettlebell swings).19 |  Combination Exercises: Squat-to-overhead press or lunge with lateral raises.19 |  Cardio: Sprinting intervals (e.g., 30 sec sprint, 90 sec walking).19 |
| **Hard** | 5-6 days strength, 2-3 days HIIT/Cardio. Rest: Varies, minimal. | **Split Routines:** Focus on specific muscle groups daily (e.g., upper/lower body split).19 |  Full-Body Workouts: Incorporate heavy compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, bench presses) with higher intensity.15 |  HIIT: High-intensity circuits and plyometrics.21 | **Functional Training:** Utilize bodyweight, kettlebells, or resistance bands for high-volume, circuit-style workouts.19 |  Cardio: Longer and more frequent HIIT sessions to burn calories and improve metabolic efficiency.19 |

### **2.2. The Mesomorph**

The Mesomorph body type is naturally athletic and muscular with a strong, solid frame.11 Individuals with this build can gain muscle and lose fat with relative ease and generally have a high metabolism and high insulin sensitivity.6 The primary challenge for mesomorphs is to maintain a balanced physique and avoid overtraining.

#### **Dietary Framework for Mesomorphs**

Mesomorphs thrive on a balanced macronutrient intake, which supports their natural propensity for muscle growth and high metabolism.6

* **Core Macronutrient Principles:** A balanced approach is most effective, with a recommended split of 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat.6 This macro split, often found in the Zone diet, can help with hormone balance and sustained energy.6 Protein intake should be high to support muscle building, with some sources recommending 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.17  
* **Globally Acceptable Food Lists:**  
  * **Proteins:** A wide variety of lean proteins is suitable, including chicken, turkey, lean beef, salmon, tuna, eggs, dairy (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese), and plant-based options (tofu, beans, lentils).6  
  * **Complex Carbohydrates:** Complex carbs are the preferred energy source to fuel workouts and support muscle growth.22 Sources include whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa), starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes), and a variety of fruits and vegetables.6  
  * **Healthy Fats:** Unsaturated fats are a priority, sourced from olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.6  
* **Recommendations by Goal and Activity Level:**  
  * **Lose Weight:** A calorie deficit is necessary for fat loss.12 A starting point of 10 to 12 kilocalories per pound of body weight is suggested, with a focus on prioritizing nutrient-dense foods to prevent overeating.6  
  * **Gain Weight:** A calorie surplus is required to build muscle.17 The recommended intake is 15 to 20 kilocalories per pound of body weight, with a high-protein, high-carb approach.12  
  * **Maintain Weight:** A neutral calorie balance is the goal, with a balanced macro split to preserve muscle mass and prevent fat gain.17

#### **Fitness Framework for Mesomorphs**

The ideal mesomorph workout plan leverages their natural ability to build muscle and respond to resistance training while incorporating cardio to maintain leanness.23

* **Core Training Principles:** The cornerstone of a mesomorph's routine is heavy strength training with a focus on progressive overload.3 This is combined with both HIIT and steady-state cardio to manage body fat and improve endurance.22 A workout frequency of four to six days per week is recommended to maintain and build muscle and burn fat efficiently.6  
* **Detailed Exercise Plan (Male/Female)**

| Exercise Complexity | Weekly Structure & Frequency | Gym-Based Exercises | Outdoor/At-Home Exercises |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Beginner** | 3 days full-body strength, 2 days light cardio. Rest: 60-90 sec between sets. | **Full-Body Strength:** Bodyweight exercises with gradual resistance.23 Focus on compound movements like squats, push-ups, and pull-ups.23 |  Cardio: Low-intensity cardio on the treadmill or elliptical.23 | **Full-Body Strength:** Bodyweight circuits with exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups.23 |  Cardio: Brisk walking, light jogging, or cycling.23 |  |  |
| **Intermediate** | 3-4 days strength, 2-3 days HIIT. Rest: 60-90 sec between sets. | **Strength:** Focus on hypertrophy (muscle growth) with 3-6 sets of 8-12 reps.22 |  Examples: Bench press, deadlifts, and squats with moderate to heavy weights.17 Add isolation exercises like bicep curls and tricep extensions.22 |  HIIT: 15-20 min sessions using plyometrics or circuits.22 | **Strength:** Bodyweight progressions and dumbbell workouts, focusing on compound movements like Bulgarian split squats and overhead presses.17 |  HIIT: Interval sprints, burpees, and kettlebell swings.19 |  Cardio: Moderate-intensity jogging or cycling.23 |
| **Hard** | 4-5 days strength (split routine), 2-3 days HIIT/Cardio. Rest: 2+ mins for strength, minimal for HIIT. | **Strength:** Heavy lifting for strength (3-6 reps) and hypertrophy (8-12 reps).23 |  Examples: Powerlifting-style squats, bench presses, and deadlifts.22 Utilize supersets to increase intensity.19 |  HIIT: High-intensity circuits with short rest periods.17 | **Athletic Training:** Incorporate activities like trail running, rock climbing, or team sports in addition to structured strength and cardio sessions.23 |  Flexibility: Integrate yoga or Pilates to improve mobility and prevent injury.22 |  |

### **2.3. The Ectomorph**

The Ectomorph body type is naturally slender and lean with a smaller bone structure.11 Individuals with this build have a fast metabolism, which makes it difficult to gain weight, whether muscle or fat.11 The primary challenge for ectomorphs is to achieve a positive energy balance and gain mass without resorting to unhealthy food choices.27

#### **Dietary Framework for Ectomorphs**

The nutritional strategy for ectomorphs is a mass-gaining diet with a high caloric and carbohydrate intake to fuel muscle growth and prevent a calorie deficit.11

* **Core Macronutrient Principles:** The ideal diet is high in carbohydrates and protein, with a balanced fat intake.24 A common macronutrient split is 45-55% carbohydrates, 25-35% protein, and 20-30% fat.12  
* **Globally Acceptable Food Lists:**  
  * **Proteins:** Protein intake is critical for muscle building.26 Lean proteins like chicken breast, fish, and lean beef, as well as plant proteins and protein shakes, are recommended.24 The recommended daily intake is 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.26  
  * **Complex Carbohydrates:** These should form the largest portion of the diet to provide sustained energy.24 Focus on whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat bread) and starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, yams).24  
  * **Healthy Fats:** Healthy fats provide a dense source of calories to support weight gain.27 Good sources include olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds, and peanut butter.26  
* **Recommendations by Goal and Activity Level:**  
  * **Lose Weight:** This is typically not a goal for pure ectomorphs, as they find it difficult to gain weight.11  
  * **Gain Weight:** A calorie surplus is essential for muscle and weight gain.11 A starting point of 15 to 20 kilocalories per pound of body weight is suggested.12 Eating more frequent, smaller meals (5-6 meals per day) and incorporating calorie-dense snacks like nuts, seeds, and smoothies is highly effective.27  
  * **Maintain Weight:** A neutral calorie balance with a continued focus on frequent, nutrient-dense meals is necessary to prevent weight loss due to a fast metabolism.17

#### **Fitness Framework for Ectomorphs**

The primary fitness goal for ectomorphs is to build muscle mass (hypertrophy) while minimizing calorie-burning activities that could hinder weight gain.11

* **Core Training Principles:** The training philosophy centers on heavy resistance training with a focus on compound movements.26 Cardio should be kept to a minimum to conserve calories for muscle growth.28 The principle of progressive overload is critical for stimulating muscle growth over time.26  
* **Detailed Exercise Plan (Male/Female)**

| Exercise Complexity | Weekly Structure & Frequency | Gym-Based Exercises | Outdoor/At-Home Exercises |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Beginner** | 3 days full-body strength, minimal cardio. Rest: 2-3 mins between sets. | Full-Body Strength: Focus on foundational compound movements using machines and light weights. Examples: Leg press, machine chest press, and assisted pull-ups.25 | **Cardio:** Limit to 1-2 sessions of 15-20 min light cardio per week.30 | Full-Body Strength: Bodyweight exercises with slow, controlled movements. Examples: Squats, push-ups, and bent-over rows using a resistance band or a sturdy anchor.9 |  |  |  |
| **Intermediate** | 3-4 days strength (split routine), minimal cardio. Rest: 60-90 sec for hypertrophy. | **Split Routine:** A body-part split (e.g., push/pull/legs) is effective.25 |  Focus: Hypertrophy with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps using moderate weights.22 |  Examples: Bench press, deadlifts, barbell squats, and overhead presses.30 Incorporate isolation exercises like bicep curls and lateral raises.30 | **Full-Body Circuits:** Incorporate bodyweight and resistance band exercises with a focus on increasing reps or sets over time.24 |  Cardio: Stick to short bursts of interval training (e.g., 20 min HIIT session) or avoid it entirely on heavy training days.30 |  |
| **Hard** | 4-5 days strength (split routine), minimal cardio. Rest: 60-90 sec for hypertrophy. | **Split Routine:** Focus on specific body parts (e.g., Chest/Triceps, Back/Biceps) with dedicated rest days.25 |  Focus: High-volume training with a combination of compound and isolation movements.25 |  Examples: Heavy barbell squats, leg presses, and stiff-leg deadlifts.25 Add exercises like hack squats and leg curls.25 |  Cardio: Limit or completely remove cardio to conserve calories.30 | **Strength:** Utilize advanced bodyweight progressions like pistol squats, one-armed push-ups, and pull-ups to failure.30 |  Core: Focus on exercises like planks and hanging leg raises to build core strength without over-burning calories.30 |

## **Part III: The Mixed Somatotype Classifications**

The most common human physiques are a blend of two primary somatotypes.2 These mixed classifications represent a more nuanced body composition and require a hybrid approach to both diet and fitness.

### **3.1. The Meso-Endomorph (or Endo-Meso)**

This physique is characterized as both muscular and strong but with a natural tendency to gain and retain body fat \[user query\]. It is a powerful, solid build, common among bodybuilders and contact sports athletes.5 The central challenge for the meso-endomorph is to manage fat gain while preserving their strong muscular base.16

* **Dietary Framework:** A meso-endomorph's diet requires a mesomorph-style approach with a critical emphasis on the endomorphic trait of careful portion control.16 During fat-loss phases, a lower-carbohydrate, higher-protein approach can be particularly effective for managing fat and improving insulin sensitivity.12  
* **Fitness Framework:** The ideal workout plan combines the strength-building focus of a mesomorph with the metabolic-boosting cardio of an endomorph.15 This can be achieved through a blend of heavy resistance training (compound lifts) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to promote muscle growth and stimulate fat loss.19

### **3.2. The Ecto-Mesomorph (or Meso-Ecto)**

This body type is naturally lean and athletic, characterized by strength and visible muscle definition without a bulky appearance.20 The key challenge for the ecto-mesomorph is to consistently provide the training stimulus and caloric surplus needed to continue gaining lean mass without losing their lean, defined physique.17

* **Dietary Framework:** The diet for this type should follow a mesomorphic plan, with a focus on increasing caloric and protein intake if the goal is to gain muscle mass.17 They typically respond well to carbohydrates and can use a high-carb, high-protein approach to fuel intense workouts and promote muscle repair and growth.12  
* **Fitness Framework:** An ecto-mesomorph benefits from a mesomorphic training protocol that includes both strength training and cardio.23 The primary focus should be on consistent progressive overload to continue stimulating muscle growth.3 Cardio can be used to maintain their lean physique, with a blend of HIIT and steady-state work.22

### **3.3. The Ecto-Endomorph (or Endo-Ecto)**

This classification is often referred to as the "skinny-fat" body type.32 It is a unique challenge because it describes an individual with a lean frame who tends to store fat, often in the midsection \[user query\]. This is frequently a behaviorally acquired physique, resulting from a sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits.2 The problem is a disproportionate fat-to-muscle ratio, not a fixed genetic predisposition.9

* **Dietary Framework:** The most effective approach is a phased nutritional strategy.20 The initial phase should follow a diet suited for an endomorph—a higher-protein, medium-fat, lower-carb plan—to prioritize fat loss and improve metabolic function.20 Once excess fat is lost, the individual can transition to an ectomorph-style diet with more carbohydrates and calories to support muscle building and prevent a return to the "skinny-fat" state.20  
* **Fitness Framework:** The most efficient plan involves a combination of resistance training and high-intensity cardio.9 Resistance training is crucial for building the muscle mass that has been neglected, while high-intensity cardio helps to stimulate metabolism and burn fat.20 A workout routine should be simple but consistent, with an emphasis on compound exercises to engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously.32

## **Part IV: Summary and System Recommendations**

The somatotype framework offers a powerful heuristic for tailoring diet and fitness plans, grounding the approach in an individual's current body composition and metabolic tendencies. To be truly effective, a system must move beyond a simple classification and provide intelligent, goal-oriented, and dynamic protocols. The following tables synthesize the recommendations into a format that can be directly applied to a system's logic, transforming complex information into actionable data.

### **4.1. The Somatotype Spectrum & Core Challenge**

| Somatotype Classification | Description | Core Challenge |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Endomorph** | Naturally soft and round, larger bone structure; tends to gain fat easily.10 | Managing a slower metabolism and insulin sensitivity to lose fat and build lean mass.10 |
| **Mesomorph** | Naturally muscular and athletic, strong frame; gains muscle and loses fat easily \[user query\]. | Maintaining a balanced physique while managing potential fat gain if training ceases.23 |
| **Ectomorph** | Naturally slender and lean, small bone structure; finds it difficult to gain weight.11 | Achieving a caloric surplus and stimulating muscle growth to gain mass.21 |
| **Endo-Meso** | Powerful, strong, and muscular but with a tendency to gain fat easily.20 | Losing fat while preserving hard-earned muscle mass and strength.16 |
| **Meso-Ecto** | Naturally lean and athletic, with visible muscle definition but not bulky \[user query\]. | Gaining mass and size without compromising their lean physique.17 |
| **Ecto-Endo** | A lean frame that has stored fat, often in the midsection; a "skinny-fat" appearance \[user query\]. | Correcting a poor fat-to-muscle ratio by first losing fat and then building muscle.9 |

### **4.2. Macronutrient Ratio Summary by Type and Goal**

The following table provides recommended macronutrient percentages. These are starting points that should be adjusted based on an individual's specific response and needs.

| Somatotype | Goal: Lose Weight | Goal: Maintain Weight | Goal: Gain Weight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Endomorph** | Carbs: 20-30% Protein: 30-40% Fat: 30-40% 10 | N/A | N/A |
| **Mesomorph** | Carbs: 33-40% Protein: 30-33% Fat: 30-33% 6 | Carbs: 40% Protein: 30% Fat: 30% 6 | Carbs: 45-55% Protein: 25-30% Fat: 15-30% 12 |
| **Ectomorph** | N/A | N/A | Carbs: 45-55% Protein: 25-35% Fat: 20-30% 24 |

| **Meso-Ecto** | Carbs: 33-40% Protein: 30-33% Fat: 30-33% 6 | Carbs: 40% Protein: 30% Fat: 30% 6 | Carbs: 45-55% Protein: 25-30% Fat: 15-30% 12 |
| **Ecto-Endo** | Phase 1 (Fat Loss): Carbs: 20-30% Protein: 30-40% Fat: 30-40% 20 | N/A | Phase 2 (Muscle Gain): Carbs: 45-55% Protein: 25-35% Fat: 20-30% 20 |

### **4.3. Exercise Compendium by Complexity and Type**
